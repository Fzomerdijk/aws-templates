# AWS-Templates
Working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), I found that most examples found on the AWS website and other GIT repositories need work and are not flexible. For example; why change a VPC template according to the number of availability zones, if you can program this within the template...
Therefor I made some "ready-to-go" AWS templates.

## Templates
* [Virtual Private Cloud - VPC (json)](./vpc/)
* [Bastion Host - high available (json)](./bastion/)
