# AWS-Templates
Working with Amazon Web Services (AWS), I found that most examples found on the AWS website and other GIT repositories are to basic and need a work before they can be used. For example; why change a VPC template according to the number of availability zones, if you can program this within the template.
Therefor I made some ready to go AWS templates that, I daily use in production environments. 

## Templates
* [Virtual Private Cloud - VPC (json)](./vpc/)
* [Bastion Host - high available (json)](./bastion/)
